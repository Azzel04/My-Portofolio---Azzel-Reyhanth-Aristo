            <h1>Pokemon Analysis</h1>
            <h5>(September 2022- Present)</h5>
            <p>
              Pokemon is one of Nintendo's best-selling games. In this game, there are many types of creatures such as animals called Pokemon that can be caught, nurtured, and trained to fight the challenges they will face. It is very
              important to maintain game balance in each generation of Pokemon games. With game balance, we can ensure that all Pokemon can be liked not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of performance as well. In addition, we
              also hope that with our data analysis, Nintendo can make decisions about the next game generation more easily. [The Tableau file can be accesed to the link in the final page of the report]

            <p>
              During my time as a college student, my teammate and I were tasked to create a website for a fictional restaurant named Danbam. This app provides several features such as an "About Us" page to learn the background of the
              restaurant, a "Menu" page where users can see some of the restaurant's best meals and drinks, a "Location" page to let the users know the locations of DanBam, and a "Contact Us" page if the user has any questions about the
              restaurant.

            <p>
              I've made a challenge for myself to lead a team of 3 in order to design an educational website. This leads me to create CS Course that provides free online courses for people to learn everything they need to know about
              Computer Science. Each different course provides an E-Book, video learning, and exercises. This website also includes a forum page where users can interact with each other and share their knowledge regarding a certain topic.

            <h1>Garmob</h1>
            <h5>(June 2022 - Present)</h5>
            <p>
              In a reasearch I have done with my teammates, we have found certain difficulties in gardening or farming. These problems resolves around uncertainty in maintaining and caring for plants, the unavailability of proper direction
              on how to farm from experts, and the ignorance in the exact harvest time. In order to slove these issues, we have come up with a solution in a form of a gardening app named GarMob or Gardening Mobile. GarMob will help someone
              in planting, by providing recommendations for tools and materials as well as planting media for each plant so that the tools and materials selected are appropriate and the user can get success in gardening and be able to
              harvest.
            </p>
